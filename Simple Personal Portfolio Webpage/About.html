        <h1> ABOUT ME !</h1>
        <p> So Hello! I'm Aeron but you can call me Ron or Brylle. I'm 21 years old and currently living in Muntinlupa City. 
        I'm currently studying Computer Science in Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I play video games since I'm young and I also
        have the likes of playing it competitively. I'm currently interested on doing video and photo editing. Mostly I edit gaming videos whenever 
        I have the likes to do it. My original dream when I was young is to be a Marine Biologist however as the life goes on I had interest on
        Studying Computers maybe because of the influence of Video Games.</p>
